To do:
    - Formulae for vapour photon interaction
    - Documentation & implement project wide unit handling
        - app
        - core
        - databases ✅
        - objects
        - particles
        - physics
        - simulation
    - Wrap some of the core files, in particular vector, in namespaces???
    - Get a reference for where my db particle and material info are from
    - Plan gas
    - Get relevant gas attributes and add them to material_database.json
    - Implement gas
    - Implement gas and photon interaction
    - Create photons with a frequency value
    - Implement multithreading for stepping; gpu too?
        - Have some way to override use of max allowed cores so user can set a lower amount of threads?
        - Probably have this thread determination in main file and alter a global var that is used in the stepping function
    - Considerations for photons slow down in non-vacuum
    - Add in polarisation to output
    - Data processing
    - Update unit printing to be actual units and not si dimension representations
    - Add in doppler shift/broadening for interaction

Model for photon absorption/emission:
    - Need to have data for a few atomic species
        - Energy levels of the two levels - extend later to more if wanted for good simulation of pumping
    - Create a temporary gas particle if interaction will occur
        - Relevant properties:
            - State it is in (Zeeman sublevel)
                - Maybe store an excited flag too for quicker comparison?
                - Have a is gas polarised flag to determine if probability is equal across all levels or biased
            - Spin/polarisation vector
                - Compute B-field unit vector
                - If storing a flag for gas being polarised check it
                    - Angle between spin vector and magnetic field axis Θ
                        - For unpolarised completely random on unit sphere
                            - θ = arccos(1 − 2r), r ∈ [0,1)
                        - For polarised bias P(Θ)
                    - Angle around magnetic field axis ϕ
                        - ϕ ∈ [0,2π)
                    - Convert to spin vector x = sin θ cos ϕ, y = sin θ sin ϕ, z = cos θ
                    - Rotate spin vector so its z aligns with the B field
            - Lifetime τ
            - Velocity form MB distribution (Maybe extend to low and high energies too with FD, BE, MJ)
        - Since simulating gas particles over time excited will need to consider larmor (arguably unnecessary for large average but prefer inclusion)
        - If an interaction occurs keep the gas particle existent until photon emission then delete

    - Interaction probabilities
        - Beer-Lambert law
            - P_absorption = 1 - e^(-σnΔx)
                - σ  = absorption cross-section
                - n  = atomic number density (atmos per unit volume)
                    - Later extend to include temperature handling according to something like August formulae or Clausius–Clapeyron relation
                - Δx = distance travelled
                    - Get from particle movement
                        - Will need to merge into particle movement function by abstracting the movement vector to a separate function
        - Add a flag for if the interaction probability isn't < 1 (Maybe allow =1?)
    - Emission direction
        - Spontaneous
            - Dipole radiation pattern (I ⍺ sin^2 Θ)
            - Emit photon after excited-state lifetime τ
                - Will cause a mismatch in time part of all the photons but this shan't be an issue as I have no photon-photon interactions
                    - Add something so it will step the difference in highest multiple of time step that fits into lifetime + 1 - τ
        - Stimulated
            - Same direction as input
            - Should be negligible compared to spontaneous
            - As something extra later on if wanted
    - Interaction
        - Selection rules
            - What transitions are allowed based on polarisation?
        - Delete photon if absorbed and create a new one on emission

Do I want to simulate any spin-exchange, spin-destruction, wall collisions for the gas?
    - Maybe add option a flag for if gas is directly simulated?
