# Physics Simulation Program

Simulate particle movement, objects, and some simple physical interactions.

All particle and object attributes are stored as a Quantity struct data type to combine a value and a unit.

Natural unit usage:
- Speed of light
- Elementary charge
- Planck constant

## Supported Physics

Minor SR in movement

## Particles

Construct individual particles or a bunch as a source

## Objects

Supported types box,
