Base
    Uniform Applied Field
        Define a global H or B vector ✅ Done a B field and H field from it

    Assigning Material Properties
        Store relative permeability or actual permeability ✅ Stored relative permeability in material db

    Find what object a point is in
        Implement on a shape by shape basis functions for contains point ✅ Box is properly implemented, sphere needs fixing
        Allow to take both local and world coordinates???
        Return all parent objects

    Field superposition
        If objects are very close may be weird
        Have a min value for distance???

Nice to have
    Boundary Continuity

    Define magnetic fields from objects

    Shape/demagnetisation effects??? - Don't know too much on how works

Should be very hard to implement
    Material Saturation

    Irregular shapes
        Not really needed for main use case of this project

    Dynamic effects
        Eddy currents
        Hysteresis
